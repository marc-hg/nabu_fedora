A set of scripts and GitHub Actions workflows to build a custom Fedora 42 image for the Xiaomi Pad 5 (nabu) device (aarch64), along with tutorials and resources for installation. The build process produces a bootable root filesystem and efi files.

> [!WARNING]
> Since this project uses the community-supported mainline kernel, some hardware features are not yet fully supported or have bugs.
> For nabu devices with **Samsung UFS chip**, please use [**this build**](https://github.com/jhuang6451/nabu_fedora/releases/tag/release-20251123-0559) (or any newer builds with Samsung UFS fix) instead.

> [!NOTE]
> The initial username is `user` and the password is `fedora`.

> [!TIP]
> Most updates will be released to pre-installed packages from [my Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jhuang6451/nabu_fedora_packages/). Check for them with `dnf upgrade`!

## Features

* **Polished UIs:** Providing choice between streamlined DEs and an unique WM: niri. Uses fcitx as default input method, providing solid out-of-the-box experience.
* **Unified Kernel Image (UKI):** Utilizes UKI for a streamlined boot process.
* **Dualboot With Android:** Installed alongside your android system, choose system at boot.
* **Latest Kernel:** Built with latest mainline for sm8150 (6.17.0).

## Installation Tutorial (Dualboot Supportive)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Re-partitioning your device wipes android's userdata, make sure all important files are backed up!

> [!NOTE]
> For those who already have an esp partition and don't want it overwritten, you can download `efi-files-xx.x.zip` from release and manually place needed efi files into esp partition.

Requirements:

* A PC.
* Internet connection.
* Your **UNLOCKED** Xiaomi Pad 5 tablet.
* USB Cable.

Steps:

1. Preparation:
    * Make sure `android-tools` is installed on your PC, or download `platform-tools` from [Official Website](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools), then decompress and cd into it.
    * Download and decompress both esp image and desired rootfs image from release.
    * Download ArKT-7's modded TWRP for nabu from [here](https://github.com/ArKT-7/twrp_device_xiaomi_nabu/releases/tag/mod_linux).
    * Download dualboot kernel patcher from [here](https://github.com/jhuang6451/nabu-dualboot-img/releases) (If you don't know what secureboot is, just download the NOSB version).

2. Partitioning:
    * Connect your tablet to your PC.
    * Reboot your tablet into bootloader (press the power bottom and the volume down bottom together, until you see `fastboot` on screen).
    * Boot into ArKT-7's modded TWRP.

        ```Shell
        fastboot boot path/to/downloaded/twrp/image
        ```

    * Wait until your tablet to boot into TWRP, then tap on the linux logo on the top right side of the screen.
    * Tap on `Partitioning` -> Enter the linux partition size -> Tap on `yes` -> Wait for partitioning to be done.

3. Install DBKP via adb sideload:
    * On your tablet, go back to the home screem of TWRP.
    * Tap on `Advanced` -> Tap on `ADB Sideload` -> Swipe the bar on the screen.
    * On your PC, run `adb sideload` command:

        ```Shell
        adb sideload path/to/installer_bootmanager.zip
        ```

4. Flash esp image:
    * Reboot your tablet into bootloader.
    * On your PC, use `fastboot` to flash esp image to `esp` partition:

        ```Shell
        fastboot flash esp path/to/esp-xx.x.img
        ```

5. Flash rootfs image:
    * Make sure your tablet is still in bootloader.
    * On your PC, use `fastboot` to flash rootfs image to `linux` partition:

        ```Shell
        fastboot flash linux path/to/fedora-xx.x-nabu-variant-rootfs.img
        ```

    * Wait for the process to complete, then reboot your tablet:

        ```Shell
        fastboot reboot
        ```

        after a while (About 1 minute), you should see the tablet reboot into UEFI interface.

        * ***Make sure to reboot with `fastboot reboot` rather than force rebooting with power bottom, or it might break the filesystem!!!***
    * You can choose between boot options with volume bottom, and confirm with power bottom.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the rootfs is decompressed.
